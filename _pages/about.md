**Hey there, Welcome!**

Hi, I have completed a Dual Master's from Carnegie Mellon University and University of Pittsburgh and my Bachelor's from Bangalore Institute of Technology. 
At CMU's Machine Learning for Signal Processing Lab, advised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj and Prof. Rita Singh, I was a Research Fellow and Project Manager. I was also the Lead TA for CMU's flagship Introduction to Deep Learning course and Large-Scale Multimedia Analysis course. I was a Guest-Instructor for Introduction to Machine Learning course at MIT. 
On the industry side, I was a Quant at Chicago Trading Company. I cofounded and built a company called as Basel Practitioners and served as CTO. Prior to that I was a researcher at Hindustan Aeronautic Limited. 
Outside work I'm an elite swimmer who qualified for the Olympics for my country.
