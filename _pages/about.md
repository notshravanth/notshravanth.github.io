**Hey there, Welcome!**

<div style="text-align: justify !important; text-justify: inter-word; hyphens: auto;">

<p>Hi, I have completed a Dual Master's from Carnegie Mellon University and University of Pittsburgh and my Bachelor's from Bangalore Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>At CMU's Machine Learning for Signal Processing Lab, advised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj and Prof. Rita Singh, I was a Research Fellow and Project Manager. I was also the Lead TA for CMU's flagship Introduction to Deep Learning course and Large-Scale Multimedia Analysis course. I was a Guest-Instructor for Introduction to Machine Learning course at MIT.</p>

<p>On the industry side, I was a Quant at Chicago Trading Company. I cofounded and built a company called Basel Practitioners and served as CTO. Prior to that I was a researcher at Hindustan Aeronautic Limited.</p>
